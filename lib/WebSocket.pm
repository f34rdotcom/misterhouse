Version: 
       1.0

Changes:
       2014-01-05: initial release weekend project

Description: 
        WebSocket is a next-generation bidirectional low latency communication 
      technology for web applications which operates over a single socket and is 
      exposed via a JavaScript interface in HTML 5 compliant browsers.

        This module provides a WebSocket server that integrates into MisterHouse.
      I have implemented a more async event based interface to the connected
      WebSocket clients. To access any message from the HTML 5 browser it is only
      necessary to subscribe with a callback function to that message type and the
      function will be called when the message arrives. 

        The latency from browser click to MH code execution or MH code sending and
      browser javascript function call should be less than 100ms. All lower level
      code uses pools and kernel level event driven sockets so minimal load is added
      to MH to run this module.

        Sending large 10K JSON informational messages to the HTML 5 based frontend 
      every 5 seconds would have minimal load on even wan based applications.

        As with all MisterHouse operations the callbacks must not block or consume
      too many cpu cycles.

Install: 
        On raspbian I had a nightmare getting cpan to work. It must be
      a debian thing but I needed stuff not available via apt-get. I will
      try and better document this later but I will have to flatten my Pi
      a few times to do it right.

      cpan[1]> install Future
      cpan[1]> install Test
      cpan[1]> install IO::Async
      cpan[1]> install IO::Socket
      cpan[1]> install Protocol::WebSocket

Usage:
        Just place it in your user code directory (code_dir in your config file).
      You must then add the following configuration items to your mh.ini

      websocket_module=WebSocket
      websocket_port=3000
      websocket_bind_ip=0.0.0.0


      # see code/examples/test_websocket.pl
      #
      # in your private code subscribe to be called on events
      # your function will have one argument the JSON message
      # from the WebSocket client
      WebSocket::subscribe('some_action', \&MyFunction);
      # send a command to all connected websockets 
      WebSocket::SendToAll("some_command");

Example:
      mh/lib/WebSocketTest.pl
      mh/web/my_mh/websockettest.html

Todo:
      more error checking
      missing functions
      improve example 
      comments and cleanup
      feature addressing pub/sub
